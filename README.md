My Bookmarks
=============================

This site was my first venture into learning Django (python-based web framework). The site also uses a very minimal amount of HTML and CSS. On this site you can view all of my favorite links for learning to different languages, sortable by category. The landing page shows all of the current bookmarks, denoted by the green circle. Clicking on the circle toggles it between green (current) and red (not-current). I haven't added a login page to limit the accessibility of this.
